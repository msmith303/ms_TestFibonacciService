			Fibonacci as a Service (FAAS) Bug Report

1. Issues

  FAAS_001:  The fibonacci back-end service retuned status code 500 on a correct GET request.

    Example:
      $ curl --request GET 'http://172.31.33.214:5000/api/fibonacci/3'

      {
         "error": "internal server error"
      }

Blocking Issues not related to the Software Under Test (SUT):
  Running the images dg-fibonacci-be and dg-fibonacci-fe worked correctly in my Docker container.
  The only issue is that the public IP was not accessible via a ping.   Testing had to be done locally on the
  AWS Machine Instance.
